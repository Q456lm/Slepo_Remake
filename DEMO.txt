Yo yo yo what’s up gamers, it’s ya boy gamerGamer67, back at it again, and today… today we’re looking at something dangerous. Something forbidden. Something the teachers do NOT want you to see.

This is Not WECIB Minecraft Simulator.

Alright, I hit start—first of all, the vibes? IMMACULATE. The screen loads in and immediately I’m stressed. Like, my heart rate just doubled. Why does a game about Minecraft in class feel more intense than half the horror games I’ve played??

Okay okay, so the whole point is Aura. Aura is everything. If you don’t have Aura, you’re basically NPC energy. So I hit SPACE and—BOOM—I’m playing Minecraft. Let’s goooo. I’m mining, I’m crafting, I’m absolutely locked in. And look at that Aura meter climbing up 👀 that’s what we like to see.

But nah nah nah—hold up. I see the teacher moving. I SEE THEM. This game does not play around. One second you’re building a dirt house, next second you’re fighting for your LIFE. I smash SPACE again, switch to “schoolwork,” and bro… that save was CLEAN. If this was real life I’d be suspended already.

What I love is how classmates react. Like, I switch back to Minecraft while they’re watching and my Aura shoots up. The respect is REAL. They know the grind. They’ve been there. That’s community right there. That’s culture.

Oh NO—NO NO NO—the teacher turned around. WHY did they turn around like that?? I panicked. I panicked hard. I forgot which button was SPACE for a second and that’s how you KNOW the game’s good. My palms are sweating. This is a classroom survival simulator.

I paused with P for a sec—because yes, this game even respects your IRL safety—and honestly? Genius design choice. Ten outta ten. No notes.

Alright we’re back. Aura’s climbing again. I’m playing risky now. Full screen Minecraft. No shame. Absolute menace behavior. And the Aura gain?? CRAZY. But that just makes the stakes higher. One wrong move and it’s over. Teachers in this game are built DIFFERENT.

And there it is. I got caught. It was tragic. It was avoidable. It was entirely my fault.

Final thoughts? This game is stupid in the BEST way. It’s funny, it’s stressful, it’s painfully relatable, and somehow it turns “playing Minecraft in class” into an actual high-risk, high-reward experience. The Aura system? Genius. The controls? Simple. The tension? UNREAL.

If you’ve ever tried to sneak a game in during class—this is your simulator.

I’m gamerGamer67, this has been Not WECIB Minecraft Simulator, and remember gamers…

Never play lowkey. That’s lame. 🎮🔥
